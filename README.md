# Simple Vertx Service

A simple REST API built using Vert.x to play around and practice using the framework and to use as a learning reference for future projects.

Right now, project includes:

- An HTTP server exposing two RESTful actions (GET user and PUT user)
- A database Vert.x service (using HSQLDB)
- Unit tests for the database and HTTP request handlers
- Integ tests for the database service
- System tests using a local server
